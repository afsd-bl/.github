# About Us 📍
This is the GitHub organisation of the [Office for Data and Statistics BL (Amt für Daten und Statistik Basel-Landschaft)](https://www.baselland.ch/politik-und-behorden/direktionen/finanz-und-kirchendirektion/daten-statistik). Here, we publish code and documents from our daily work that may be of interest to the community and external partners.

# Getting in Touch ☎️
Our organisation hosts repositories from multiple divisions within our department. For specific questions, please check the README file in each repository for contact details. If a repository does not provide direct contact information, please contact us at [daten@bl.ch](mailto:daten@bl.ch).

# Contributing 🖥️
Most of our code development takes place in a private GitLab environment, making this GitHub organisation primarily an outlet for completed projects. If you would like to contribute or have questions about recent updates, we recommend that you contact us directly. You are also welcome to fork and use the code in accordance with each individual repository's specified usage rights.
